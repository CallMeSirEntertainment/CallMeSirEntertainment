# Why I started to code.

## I was inspired by several people, such as:
[Anuken](https://www.github.com/Anuken), Markus "Notch" Persson, [Jonas Tyroller](https://www.youtube.com/@jonastyroller), etc!

## I want to make a career for myself.
According to [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career/python-developer/salaries), the average salary for a python developer is $124,056 per year in the United States. This would be massive, as the average salary in the US is just over 50k.

## I want other people to start coding as well.
I started coding because of other programmers, I know that if I code, I'll inspire other people to code as well.

## To solve problems.
I've used code to do several things, such as making a super efficient keyboard layout for myself that helps me type faster, and a calculator made specifically for Mindustry schematics (yeah, I'm a nerd).

## To understand computers better.
I've always been curious about how computers work, and programming has really helped me understand a lot more about how they work.

## To be more creative.
Believe me when I say that...I've never been a creative type. However, I truly believe that coding has actually helped me be more creative.
