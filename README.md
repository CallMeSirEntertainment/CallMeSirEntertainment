# Why I started to code.

## I was inspired by several people, such as:
[Anuken](https://www.github.com/Anuken), Markus "Notch" Persson, [Jonas Tyroller](https://www.youtube.com/@jonastyroller), and even [GD Colon](https://www.gdcolon.com)! I especially would like to help Anuken on his project of [Mindustry](https://www.github.com/Anuken/Mindustry), as I am very fond of the game.
## I want to make a career for myself.
According to [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career/python-developer/salaries), the average salary for a python developer is $122,713 per year in the United States. This would be massive, as the average salery in the US is just over 50k.
## I want other people to start coding as well.
Because I started coding because of other coders, I know that if I code, I'll inspire other people to code as well. This starts a chain reaction of people trying new things, and it really helps the coding community.
