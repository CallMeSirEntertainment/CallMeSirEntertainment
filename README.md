Sure, here's your text merged with the additional points:

# Why I started to code.

## I was inspired by several people, such as:
[Anuken](https://www.github.com/Anuken), Markus "Notch" Persson, [Jonas Tyroller](https://www.youtube.com/@jonastyroller), and even [GD Colon](https://www.gdcolon.com)! I especially would like to help Anuken on his project of [Mindustry](https://www.github.com/Anuken/Mindustry), as I am very fond of the game.

## I want to make a career for myself.
According to [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/career/python-developer/salaries), the average salary for a python developer is $122,713 per year in the United States. This would be massive, as the average salary in the US is just over 50k.

## I want other people to start coding as well.
Because I started coding because of other coders, I know that if I code, I'll inspire other people to code as well. This starts a chain reaction of people trying new things, and it really helps the coding community.

## To Solve Problems
Coding allows you to create solutions for a variety of problems. Whether it's automating a repetitive task, creating a useful tool, or building a fun game, coding empowers you to bring your ideas to life.

## To Understand the World
In our increasingly digital world, understanding coding can provide valuable insights. It can help you understand how the apps, websites, and technologies you use every day work.

## To Be Creative
Coding is a highly creative activity. Whether you're designing a website, developing an app, or creating a game, coding allows you to express your creativity and make something completely unique.

## To Improve Career Prospects
In addition to being a lucrative career choice, coding skills are in high demand across many industries. Even if you don't want to be a full-time developer, having coding skills can open up new opportunities and enhance your career.
